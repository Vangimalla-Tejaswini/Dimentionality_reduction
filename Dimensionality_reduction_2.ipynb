    " In the context of PCA (Principal Component Analysis), a projection refers to the transformation of high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the principal components. In PCA, principal components are orthogonal vectors that capture the directions of maximum variance in the data. The projection involves finding the linear combination of the original features that maximizes the variance along each principal component."
